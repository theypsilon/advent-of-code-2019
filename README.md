# Advent of Code 2019
Solutions for [AoC](https://adventofcode.com/2019/) done in Rust.

Every solution has its own dependency-free crate, with a single self-contained main.rs, so it can be run with an online compiler entirely and thus you don't need to install rust in your system to test them. Just copy/paste them into https://play.rust-lang.org/

I try to keep it simple. I implement tests quite often as a mean to reduce the surface of the problems, and also to get frequent feedback about possible regressions.
